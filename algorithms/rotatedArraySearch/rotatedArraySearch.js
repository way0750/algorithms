/*
 * Given a sorted array that has been rotated some number of items right or
 * left, i.e. [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7] might become [4, 5, 6, 7, 0, 1, 2, 3]
 * how can you efficiently find an element? For simplicity, you can assume
 * that there are no duplicate elements in the array.
 *
 * rotatedArraySearch should return the index of the element if it is in the
 * array and should return null otherwise.
 *
 * For instance:
 * rotatedArraySearch([4, 5, 6, 0, 1, 2, 3], 2) === 5
 *
 * rotatedArraySearch([4, 5, 6, 0, 1, 2, 3], 100) === null
 *
 * 
 * Target time complexity: O(log(array.length)) O(log(n))

// input an sorted array of num that might be rotated, and a target num
// output index of target within the array or null if not found
// 
// if not rotated [4,5,6,7,8,9] target: 100, just check start and end of the array
// if target is within the range, find it using binary search, if not return null
// if it is rotated: can tell by comparing start and end of the array/range, if end is less than start then
//  it has to be rotated. Or at least the current range is
//  
// maybe should only search in a non-rotated range that over laps with the target
// or if that range doesn't exist, but a rotated range exist, then check that
// 
// using binary to search, there will be two ranges
//  for each one of them, need to ask: is it non-rotated and overlaps with target? or is it rotated
//  so 4 ifs?
