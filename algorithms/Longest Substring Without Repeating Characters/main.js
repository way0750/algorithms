/*
   maybe should make a function to take an input that string then format it
   and make things easier to paste into a file like this;
     should add indentation if certain line is too long

   Given a string, find the length of the longest substring without repeating
    characters.

   Examples:

   Given "abcabcbb", the answer is "abc", which the length is 3.

   Given "bbbbb", the answer is "b", with the length of 1.

   Given "pwwkew", the answer is "wke", with the length of 3. Note that the
     answer must be a substring, "pwke" is a subsequence and not a substring.
